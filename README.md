You've found my portfolio! I'm Julius Dorfman. I engineer ambitious applications and design them with a minimalist aesthetic.

This website is where I publish my works; an expression of my creativity through design, code, and writing. This site will hold the bookmarks of my life in: projects, articles, and career history. While you're here, thank you for being a part of it.
